Sine Nomine 2.5D
================

Sine Nomine 2.5D is an experiment to turn the classic ASCII roguelike
aesthetics into something approximating a 3D representation. This is not a
game, there is no gameplay to be found here (yet).

Sine Nomine 2.5D is written in Lua and using the LÃ–VE framework. The font used
is Press Start 2P, find more information in `game/font/`.

Currently it looks like this:
